# LoRa Image Transmission System

A robust Arduino-based solution for transmitting image data over LoRa (Long Range) radio networks. This project implements packet-based transmission with headers and markers to ensure reliable image transfer.

## Features

- **Packet-based transmission** - Splits large images into manageable chunks
- **Header protocol** - Each packet includes sequence information for reliable reconstruction
- **Start/End markers** - Clear transmission boundaries with metadata
- **Visual feedback** - Built-in LED indicates transmission status
- **Error handling** - CRC enabled for data integrity
- **Configurable parameters** - Easy adjustment of LoRa settings

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 or compatible microcontroller
- LoRa module (e.g., SX1276/SX1278)
- Antenna (433 MHz or appropriate frequency)

### Pin Configuration

```cpp
SS (Chip Select):  GPIO 5
RST (Reset):       GPIO 17
DIO0 (Interrupt):  GPIO 4
LED:               GPIO 22
```

## LoRa Configuration

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Frequency | 433 MHz | ISM band (adjust for your region) |
| Sync Word | 0x34 | Network identifier |
| Spreading Factor | 7 | Balance between range and speed |
| Bandwidth | 250 kHz | Signal bandwidth |
| Coding Rate | 4/5 | Error correction overhead |
| CRC | Enabled | Cyclic redundancy check |

## Installation

1. **Install Arduino IDE** (version 1.8.x or later)

2. **Install required libraries:**
   - [LoRa library by Sandeep Mistry](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa)
   ```
   Arduino IDE: Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries → Search "LoRa"
   ```

3. **Configure board:**
   - Select your ESP32 board from Tools → Board
   - Select the correct COM port

4. **Upload the code** to your device

## Usage

### Preparing Your Image

1. Convert your image to a byte array:
   - Use online tools or Python scripts to convert images to hex byte arrays
   - Replace the placeholder `myImageBytes[]` array with your image data

2. **Example conversion (Python):**
   ```python
   with open('image.jpg', 'rb') as f:
       bytes_data = f.read()
       hex_array = ', '.join([f'0x{b:02X}' for b in bytes_data])
       print(f'uint8_t myImageBytes[] = {{{hex_array}}};')
   ```

### Transmission Protocol

The system uses a three-phase transmission protocol:

1. **START marker** - Sends total image size and packet count
2. **DATA packets** - Sequential packets with headers and image chunks
3. **END marker** - Signals transmission completion

### Packet Structure

Each data packet contains:
- **Header (6 bytes)**
  - `packetId` (2 bytes): Packet sequence number
  - `totalPackets` (2 bytes): Total number of packets
  - `dataSize` (2 bytes): Bytes in current packet
- **Payload (up to 234 bytes)**: Image data chunk

## Configuration Options

### Adjusting Packet Size

```cpp
#define MAX_PACKET_SIZE 240  // Maximum LoRa payload (adjust if needed)
```

### Changing Transmission Delay

```cpp
delay(30000);  // Time between transmissions (milliseconds)
delay(50);     // Delay between packets (milliseconds)
```

### Frequency Settings

Modify the frequency based on your region:
```cpp
LoRa.begin(433E6);  // 433 MHz (Europe/Asia)
// LoRa.begin(915E6);  // 915 MHz (Americas)
// LoRa.begin(868E6);  // 868 MHz (Europe)
```

## Receiver Implementation

This code handles transmission only. To receive images, you'll need a companion receiver that:
1. Listens for `IMG_START` markers
2. Collects and orders packets by `packetId`
3. Reconstructs the image from received chunks
4. Detects `IMG_END` marker for completion

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Starting LoRa failed!" | Check wiring, verify pin connections |
| LED not blinking | Verify GPIO 22 is correct for your board |
| No transmission | Check antenna connection |
| Incomplete transmission | Increase delay between packets |

## Performance Notes

- **Transmission time** depends on image size and LoRa settings
- **Typical speed**: ~1-5 kbps at SF7
- **Range**: Up to 2-10 km (line of sight, depends on environment)
- **Larger spreading factors** = longer range but slower speed
